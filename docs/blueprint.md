# **App Name**: Scan-ShieldAI

## Core Features:

- AIVulnerabilityScan: AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanning: Automatically scan web and mobile applications for vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10, API misconfigurations, etc.) using AI. LLMs act as tools to incorporate data on past exploits in decisions.
- NaturalLanguageReports: Natural Language Reporting: Generate technical reports and actionable recommendations in natural language (e.g., 'Fix this endpoint with this code...') powered by LLMs, providing clear and understandable guidance.
- AttackSimulation: Attack Simulation: Simulate low-risk attacks (automated pentesting) to identify vulnerabilities and assess security posture.
- CustomizedSecurity: Customized Recommendations: Offer customized security recommendations based on the technology stack and DevSecOps maturity level using AI.
- CICDIntegration: CI/CD Integration: Integrate with GitHub/GitLab for security analysis on each pull request (shift-left security).
- ScanAsService: Scan-as-a-Service: Provide on-demand security scanning for web and mobile apps. Manage user subscriptions, authentication and roles.
- APIAccess: API Access: REST API for developers to integrate security scanning into their existing workflows and tools.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#708090) for a secure, reliable, and understated feel.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) to create a clean and professional look.
- Accent color: Steel blue (#4682B4) to draw attention to calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a modern, objective feel. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, clear, and professional icons, inspired by Apple's minimalist design language. Stick to black or dark gray, and incorporate the accent color sparingly for interactive or actionable elements.
- Design the UI with a minimalist, understated approach heavily influenced by the apple.com website model. Focus on clear information hierarchy and ease of use.
- Employ subtle animations to enhance user experience without being distracting. Use smooth transitions for loading indicators and confirmations.
